# Predict Customer Churn

- Project **Predict Customer Churn** of ML DevOps Engineer Nanodegree Udacity

## Project Description
this project consists in make a analysis about data of a company that want to know how many client are going to churn. 
We do an descriptive analysis about the data, and using machine learning a predictive analysis, the output of this is a 
model that can be used for predict the churn of clients in the future with a 90% of accuracy.


## Running Files
1. first step, is running the requirement.txt to install all the libraries, you can do it in a virtual environment
2. if you want to run all the files to get the result, you can run the churn_library.py with the command "python churn_library_solution.py"
3. But you can also run all the function independy, import the churn_library_solution.py in a file, and invoke each of the functions (Take care with the arg of each function)
4. you can run command "pylint scripts.py" to see the score of good practice of coding to this files


## Running test and log
1. Run the test and log file using "python churn_script_logging_and_tests_solution.py"
2. It will being running for few minuts, at the end, you can check the log file in the log folder
3. the log is stored with the name churn_library*Date today*_*time now*.log
4. In the casses that the function run without problem the message "SUCCES" apper, in the other case the message will be "ERROR"
5. Some of the function need that other run succes, if this dont happend, ERROR will appear by these moment
